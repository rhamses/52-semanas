## ABOUT THE PROJECT
The 52 Week Challenge is the very first step for anyone who wants to save money, and more important, develop the **habbit** of saving money. It consists in create a reachable goal that lasts an entire year (e.g Buy a M1 Macbook Air 2022 in 2023) then divide the good's value in equal stallments due every single week of the year. If all runs smoothly you'll have the full value saved somewhere.

This 52 Week Challenge repo is a Web App (PWA) that helps you with that. It runs everything directly in your browser, without any servers, databases or third party trackers of any kind. All you need to do is access the project's URL and starting using. It can notified you near the stallment's due date, warning you if there's something unpaid and send you motivational messages to boots the morale.
